# 📧 Netlify Email Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
The Netlify function is returning "API key is invalid" because the environment variable isn't properly configured.

## ✅ Fix Steps

### 1. **Add Environment Variable in Netlify Dashboard**

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
3. Click **Add a variable**
4. Add:
   ```
   Key: RESEND_API_KEY
   Value: re_182Ve4zV_NwzabtQkVwm61jdFUaQLxBz6
   ```
5. Click **Save**

### 2. **Redeploy the Site**

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### 3. **Test Email Function**

The function will now work and send real emails when:
- User registers (welcome email)
- User unlocks badges (achievement emails)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **Before Fix (Current)**
```
⚠️ Netlify function not available: API key is invalid
```

### **After Fix**
```
✅ Real email sent via Netlify + Resend!
📧 Email ID: [resend-email-id]
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Disable Email Temporarily

If you want to disable email sending temporarily, you can comment out the email calls in `LogEntryForm.jsx`:

```javascript
// Temporarily disable email sending
// if (currentUser.email) {
//   await realEmailService.sendBadgeUnlockedEmail(...)
// }
```

## 📱 Production Email Features

Once the environment variable is set correctly:

- ✅ **Welcome emails** when users register
- ✅ **Badge unlock emails** with beautiful HTML design
- ✅ **Real email delivery** via Resend API
- ✅ **Professional email templates** with gradients and styling

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add the environment variable** in Netlify dashboard
2. **Redeploy the site**
3. **Test by creating a new entry** to trigger badge unlock email
4. **Check your email inbox** for the badge notification

The email system will work perfectly once the API key is properly configured! 📧✨
